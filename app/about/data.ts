			"I have been practicing with Sarah since she and her family moved to the Seacoast. I realized early on that Sarah had a passion for “teaching” yoga and pushing her students to do poses they didn't realize they were capable of. When other teachers guide you through the same flow, Sarah shows that there is more to a pose than just going through the motions. When the pandemic hit and studios were closed or classes were cut back, I missed being able to practice with Sarah. Making the decision to schedule private classes has been the best decision, and my practice has evolved into something that I wanted it to be - not just the same old Vinyasa flow classes we all have been to. If you want to take your practice to a higher level I highly recommend giving Sarah a call.",

			"I am delighted to review a yoga series I was fortunate to participate in led by Sarah Krzyzanowski. Sarah is a kind, thoughtful, caring individual and a gifted yoga teacher. Since a bike accident and broken pelvis a few years ago I have had difficulty with tight hips. When I heard that Sarah was teaching a series on hip openers I knew this was for me. Not that I like those poses but trusted that Sarah would guide me in these very difficult (for me) poses. The first session I could not even attempt gomukhasana, fire log pose, or variations on a pigeon pose. Sarah modified and gave me many suggestions for adjustments that began my journey to more flexible hips. I now have a daily practice of hip poses that have given me physical relief as well as much happiness that comes from seeing improvement. What is truly amazing, Sarah did all of this on Zoom. If you want to begin a practice, fine tune your current practice and treat yourself to an awe-inspiring yoga experience contact Sarah.",
