---

## Development Workflow

### Running the App
```bash
# Install dependencies
pnpm install

# Run database migrations
npx prisma migrate dev

# Seed class pass products (run once)
npx tsx prisma/seed-class-pass.ts

# Start development server
pnpm dev
```

### Database Migrations
```bash
# Create new migration
npx prisma migrate dev --name migration_name

# Generate Prisma Client
npx prisma generate

# View database in Prisma Studio
npx prisma studio
```

### Adding New Products

**Option 1: Directly in Database**
Use Prisma Studio or SQL to add products

**Option 2: Seed Script**
Create a seed file like `prisma/seed-class-pass.ts`:
```typescript
const product = await prisma.product.create({
  data: {
    name: "Product Name",
    description: "Description here",
    price: 100,
    type: "CLASS_PASS", // or CLASS, WORKSHOP, OTHER
    variants: {
      create: [
        { name: "Option 1", price: 50, quantity: 1 },
        { name: "Option 2", price: 90, quantity: 2 },
      ]
    }
  }
});
```

---

## Payment Flow

### Complete Purchase Flow

1. **Add to Cart**
   - Customer selects product (optionally with variant)
   - `POST /api/cart` with `{ productId, variantId? }`
   - Cart stored in database, ID in localStorage for guests

2. **Checkout**
   - Navigate to `/booking/checkout`
   - Cart items fetched with product and variant details
   - Enter billing details
   - Optional: Apply promo code
   - `POST /api/promo-code/validate` checks validity
   - `POST /api/payment/intent` creates Stripe PaymentIntent with final amount

3. **Payment**
   - Enter card details via Stripe CardElement
   - `stripe.confirmCardPayment()` processes payment
   - On success: `POST /api/payment/confirm`

4. **Order Creation**
   - Payment confirmed in Stripe
   - Order created with:
     - Order items (with variantId if applicable)
     - Promo code linkage (if used)
     - User/guest information
   - Promo code usage count incremented
   - Cart cleared
   - Confirmation email sent
   - Redirect to `/booking/success`

---

## Promo Code Implementation Details

### Validation Logic (`/api/promo-code/validate`)
1. Check if code exists
2. Verify `isActive === true`
3. Check expiration date (if set)
4. Check `usedCount < maxUses` (if maxUses set)
5. Calculate discount based on type:
   - `PERCENTAGE`: total * (value / 100)
   - `FIXED_AMOUNT`: min(value, total)
   - `FREE_CLASS`: total (100% off)
6. Return discount and new total

### Recording Usage (`/api/payment/confirm`)
1. Order created with promo code reference
2. `OrderPromoCode` junction record created
3. `PromoCode.usedCount` incremented by 1
4. Discount amount saved for reporting

### Admin Controls
- **Deactivate** instead of delete for codes with usage history
- **Edit** limits, expiration, or value
- **View** usage statistics in table

---

## Product Variants Implementation

### Database Structure
```prisma
Product (parent)
  â””â”€ ProductVariant[] (children)
       â”œâ”€ name: "5 Class Pass"
       â”œâ”€ price: 75
       â””â”€ quantity: 5
```

### UI Flow
1. **Product Display**: Shows all variants as radio buttons
2. **Price Update**: Price tag updates when variant selected
3. **Add to Cart**: `variantId` passed to cart API
4. **Cart Display**: Shows "Product Name - Variant Name"
5. **Checkout**: Uses variant price for total calculation
6. **Order**: `OrderItem` includes `variantId` reference

### Cart Storage
- CartItem includes `variantId` field
- Same product + different variant = separate cart items
- Same product + same variant = quantity increment

---

3. Create product with new type
4. Filter by type in `ReservationComponent.tsx` if needed

---

## Security Considerations

### Admin Routes
- All `/api/admin/*` routes check session and role
- Return 401 if not authenticated or not admin
- Use `getServerSession(authOptions)` consistently

### Payment Security
- Never store credit card details (handled by Stripe)
- Payment intents created server-side only
- Client secret passed to client for confirmation
- Payment confirmation happens server-side

### Promo Code Security
- Codes are case-insensitive (converted to uppercase)
- Validation happens server-side
- Cannot be reused beyond max usage limit
- Cannot be used after expiration

### Guest Checkout
- Cart ID stored in localStorage
- Cart items stored in database, not client
- Guest user created with minimal info (email only)
- Proper cleanup after checkout

---

## Deployment Notes

### Database Migrations
- Always run migrations before deploying: `npx prisma migrate deploy`
- Prisma Client is regenerated during build

### Environment Variables
- Set all required env vars in production
- Use production Stripe keys for live site
- Ensure DATABASE_URL points to production database

### Initial Setup
- Run `npx tsx prisma/seed-class-pass.ts` to create class passes
- Create admin user with role="admin"
- Test promo code creation before going live

---

## Future Enhancements

Potential features to add:
- [ ] Promo code auto-apply by URL parameter (`?code=WELCOME10`)
- [ ] User-specific promo codes (one-time codes per email)
- [ ] Promo code analytics dashboard
- [ ] Class pass usage tracking (redemption system)
- [ ] Gift cards/vouchers
- [ ] Recurring subscription products
- [ ] Referral system with automatic code generation

---

## Troubleshooting

### Promo Code Not Applying
1. Check if code is active in admin dashboard
2. Verify expiration date hasn't passed
3. Check if max uses reached
4. Ensure code is entered exactly (spaces, capitalization)

### Variant Not Showing Price
1. Verify variant has a price set in database
2. Check that product type filter is correct
3. Ensure `GET /api/products` includes variants

### Cart Not Persisting for Guests
1. Check localStorage for `cartId`
2. Verify cart exists in database with that ID
3. Check that `x-cart-id` header is being sent

### Payment Fails
1. Verify Stripe keys are set correctly
2. Check Stripe dashboard for error details
3. Ensure payment intent amount matches cart total
4. Verify webhooks are configured (if using webhooks)
